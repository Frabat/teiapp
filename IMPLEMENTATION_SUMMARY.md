### Utility Components
- `LoadingSpinner.tsx`: Reusable loading indicator
- `ErrorBoundary.tsx`: Application-wide error handling

### State Management
- `fileSlice.ts`: Redux slice for file operations
- Updated `store.ts`: Integrated file management state

## Updated Components

### Core Application
- `App.tsx`: Added new routes and error boundary
- `firebase.ts`: Fixed configuration and added storage
- `AuthGuard.tsx`: Improved authentication flow
- `authSlice.ts`: Enhanced type safety

### Authentication
- `sign-in.tsx`: Updated redirects to home page
- `sign-up.tsx`: Updated redirects to home page
- `welcome.tsx`: Updated navigation for authenticated users

```

## New Features Implemented

### File Management
- **Drag & Drop Upload**: Modern file upload interface
- **Multiple File Types**: Support for various document and image formats
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress indicators
- **File Operations**: Complete CRUD operations for files
- **Storage Analytics**: File count and storage usage tracking

### User Experience
- **Responsive Dashboard**: Modern, mobile-friendly interface
- **Quick Actions**: Easy access to common operations
- **File Preview**: View files directly in the browser
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and recovery options

### Security
- **User Isolation**: Each user has separate file storage
- **Authentication Required**: All operations require valid login
- **Secure Storage**: Firebase Storage with configurable rules
- **Input Validation**: File type and size validation

## Technical Improvements

### Performance
- **Efficient State Management**: Redux Toolkit for optimized updates
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load only when needed
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time feedback for long operations
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of network issues

### Code Quality

- **Component Reusability**: Modular, maintainable components
- **Consistent Styling**: Material-UI based design system

### Developer Experience
- **Clear Documentation**: Comprehensive README and setup guides
- **Environment Configuration**: Clear setup instructions
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages and debugging info
- **Code Structure**: Logical organization and naming conventions

## Setup Requirements

### Dependencies Added
- `react-dropzone`: File upload functionality
- Enhanced Firebase configuration

### Environment Variables
All Firebase environment variables must use `VITE_` prefix:
```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
```

### Firebase Configuration
1. Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
2. Enable Storage with security rules
3. Configure web app in Firebase console

## Usage Instructions

### For End Users
1. Sign up or sign in to the application
2. Use the home page to manage files
