  - [ ] `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
  - [ ] `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
  - [ ] `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
  - [ ] `VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID`

### 4. Code Configuration
- [ ] Vite config has correct base path (`/teiapp/`)
- [ ] React Router has proper basename configuration
- [ ] 404.html file is in public directory

npm run build

# Test preview
npm run preview
```

### Step 2: Manual Deployment (Optional)
```bash
# Deploy manually if needed
npm run deploy
```

### Step 3: Automated Deployment
1. **Push to Main Branch**: The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically trigger
2. **Monitor Workflow**: Check Actions tab for build progress
3. **Verify Deployment**: Check Pages tab for deployment status

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Application Access
- [ ] App is accessible at `https://username.github.io/teiapp`
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] All routes work correctly
- [ ] Authentication flows work

### 2. Functionality Testing
- [ ] File upload works
- [ ] TEI XML viewer displays correctly
- [ ] User authentication works
- [ ] File management operations work

### 3. Performance Check
- [ ] Page loads within reasonable time
- [ ] No major performance issues
- [ ] Assets are properly optimized
- [ ] Code splitting works correctly

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Check for TypeScript errors
npm run build
```

#### Deployment Issues
- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Verify repository permissions
- Ensure Pages source is set to GitHub Actions
- Check workflow file syntax

#### Routing Issues
- Verify 404.html is in public directory
- Check React Router basename configuration
- Test with production build locally

#### Environment Variables
- Verify all Firebase variables are set
- Check variable naming (must start with `VITE_`)
- Ensure variables are in repository secrets

## üìä Monitoring

### GitHub Pages Analytics
- Built-in analytics in repository Settings ‚Üí Pages
- Monitor page views and performance
- Check for any deployment errors

### Application Monitoring
- Firebase Analytics (if configured)
- Error boundary logging
- Performance metrics

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Monitor GitHub Actions performance
- [ ] Check for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Review and update deployment configuration

### Updates
- [ ] Test locally before pushing
- [ ] Monitor deployment status
- [ ] Verify functionality after updates
- [ ] Rollback if necessary
